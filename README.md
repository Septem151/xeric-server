## Support the Project

If you enjoy using this plugin and would like to support us financially, please consider supporting [Septem on Ko-Fi](https://Ko-fi.com/Septem) (all proceeds go to Septem directly). Anything is appreciated, as running a server is not free! The project costs ~$12 annually and $5 monthly to keep the servers running.
